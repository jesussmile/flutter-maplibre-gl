# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Hillshading Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add support for hillshade visualization using pre-processed LERC files in the MapLibre GL example rather than using MapLibre's built-in hillshade.
# Details:
Refer to the following documentation for guidance: `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/hillshading_support.md` and `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/multiple_terrain_rendering_modes.md`. Note that the documentation was written for flutter_map and will need adaptation for MapLibre GL, and discusses both real-time and pre-processed hillshade approaches. Work exclusively within the `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/maplibre_gl_example` directory. As specified in the PRD, implement support for hillshade visualization using pre-processed LERC2 files that are already converted to look like hillshade, rather than using MapLibre's built-in hillshade layer. Create the necessary loading and rendering mechanisms for these specialized LERC2 files. Integrate this hillshade data into the rendering pipeline. This might involve generating a separate hillshade texture/layer or combining the hillshade data with the existing terrain visualization. Document the hillshade implementation approach, including how the pre-processed LERC2 files are structured and how they differ from standard elevation data. Include information about where to obtain or how to generate these specialized hillshade LERC2 files. Document any rendering considerations specific to hillshade data.

# Test Strategy:
Add hillshading as a selectable visualization mode (requires Task 7). Switch to hillshade mode and verify that terrain features (hills, valleys) are rendered with appropriate shading. Compare against known hillshade examples if possible.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Hillshade Data Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement hillshade data loading and decoding from specialized LERC2 files
### Details:
Create a system to load and decode pre-processed hillshade LERC2 files that contain hillshade data rather than raw elevation data. Adapt the existing LERC decoder to handle the specialized format of hillshade LERC files if they differ from standard elevation LERC files. Implement a data structure to hold the decoded hillshade data. Integrate hillshade loading into the tile management system (from Task 5). Create a mechanism to determine which hillshade tiles need to be loaded based on current view. Implement efficient error handling for missing or corrupted hillshade data. Document the hillshade data format and how it differs from standard elevation LERC data. Include information on how these specialized hillshade LERC files are generated.

## 2. Implement Hillshade Rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement hillshade rendering in the terrain visualization pipeline
### Details:
Integrate hillshade rendering into the terrain visualization pipeline, allowing it to be used as a standalone visualization mode or combined with other visualization modes. Create shader code to render the hillshade data with appropriate contrast and lighting effects. Implement blending modes to combine hillshade with other terrain visualizations, such as gradient coloring. Add options to control hillshade intensity, contrast, and other visual parameters. Implement UI controls for adjusting hillshade visualization (part of Task 7). Test the hillshade rendering with different terrain types to ensure effective visualization across varied landscapes. Document the rendering approach, including the math behind hillshade rendering and implementation details for both platforms.
