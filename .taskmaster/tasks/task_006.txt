# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Enhanced Visualization Modes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement enhanced terrain visualization modes in the MapLibre GL example, including altitude-based color gradients, reference altitude highlighting, warning levels, and altitude bucketing.
# Details:
Refer to the following documentation for guidance: `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/multiple_terrain_rendering_modes.md`, `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/altitude_based_terrain_coloring.md`, `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/reference_altitude_and_warning_levels.md`, and `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/altitude_bucketing.md`. Note that the documentation was written for flutter_map and will need adaptation for MapLibre GL. Work exclusively within the `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/maplibre_gl_example` directory. Extend the rendering logic (either in Dart if rendering to texture, or native shaders if rendering natively) to support different coloring algorithms. Implement a continuous color gradient based on elevation. Add logic to highlight areas above/below a user-defined 'reference altitude' and 'warning levels' using distinct colors or overlays. Implement altitude bucketing by quantizing elevation values into discrete ranges before coloring to create smoother transitions or distinct elevation bands. These modes should be selectable. Document each visualization mode in detail, including the algorithms used, color schemes selected, and how they help users interpret terrain data. Include screenshots or examples showing the different modes and their effects. Document any performance implications of each mode.

# Test Strategy:
Add internal flags or parameters to switch between visualization modes. Manually test each mode with sample data to ensure colors and highlighting appear as expected based on elevation values and configured reference/warning levels. Verify bucketing reduces visual noise.
