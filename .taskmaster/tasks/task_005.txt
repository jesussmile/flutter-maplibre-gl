# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Basic Terrain Layer Rendering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a mechanism to render the decoded terrain elevation data on the MapLibre GL map within the existing example app, starting with a simple elevation-based coloring.
# Details:
Refer to the following documentation for guidance: `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/flutter_map_terrain_layer.md`, `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/flutter_map_tile_provider.md`, and `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/altitude_based_terrain_coloring.md`. Note that these documents are for flutter_map and will require significant adaptation for MapLibre GL. Work exclusively within the `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/maplibre_gl_example` directory. This is a critical integration point. Since `flutter-maplibre-gl` doesn't have a direct 'custom layer' API like some other map SDKs, the most direct path involves either: 1) Using a `PlatformView` to render the terrain on top, synchronized with the map, or 2) Passing tile data and rendering commands to the native MapLibre GL view via `MethodChannel` to draw within its rendering loop (more complex but better integrated). Given the PRD mentions integrating with the 'rendering pipeline', the MethodChannel approach is preferred. Implement a Dart component that listens to map camera changes, determines visible terrain tiles, requests LERC data for those tiles, decodes it (using Task 3), and sends the decoded data (or a representation) and tile coordinates to the native side via `MethodChannel`. On the native side (Android/iOS), receive this data and implement custom OpenGL/Vulkan rendering logic within the MapLibre GL view's rendering callback (if the native SDK allows hooking into it) or as an overlay. Start with a simple color mapping (e.g., green for low altitude, brown for high). Implement coordinate conversion from map tile coordinates to the decoded LERC data grid indices. Document the integration approach thoroughly, including alternative approaches considered, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented. Create diagrams or flowcharts if needed to explain the architecture for future reference.

# Test Strategy:
Load a map view covering an area with known terrain data. Verify that colored terrain appears on the map corresponding to elevation. Pan and zoom to ensure new tiles are loaded and rendered correctly.
