# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Basic Terrain Layer Rendering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a mechanism to render the decoded terrain elevation data on the MapLibre GL map within the existing example app, starting with a simple elevation-based coloring.
# Details:
Refer to the following documentation for guidance: `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/flutter_map_terrain_layer.md`, `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/flutter_map_tile_provider.md`, and `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/altitude_based_terrain_coloring.md`. Note that these documents are for flutter_map and will require significant adaptation for MapLibre GL. Work exclusively within the `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/maplibre_gl_example` directory. This is a critical integration point. Since `flutter-maplibre-gl` doesn't have a direct 'custom layer' API like some other map SDKs, the most direct path involves either: 1) Using a `PlatformView` to render the terrain on top, synchronized with the map, or 2) Passing tile data and rendering commands to the native MapLibre GL view via `MethodChannel` to draw within its rendering loop (more complex but better integrated). Given the PRD mentions integrating with the 'rendering pipeline', the MethodChannel approach is preferred. Implement a Dart component that listens to map camera changes, determines visible terrain tiles, requests LERC data for those tiles, decodes it (using Task 3), and sends the decoded data (or a representation) and tile coordinates to the native side via `MethodChannel`. On the native side (Android/iOS), receive this data and implement custom OpenGL/Vulkan rendering logic within the MapLibre GL view's rendering callback (if the native SDK allows hooking into it) or as an overlay. Start with a simple color mapping (e.g., green for low altitude, brown for high). Implement coordinate conversion from map tile coordinates to the decoded LERC data grid indices. Document the integration approach thoroughly, including alternative approaches considered, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented. Create diagrams or flowcharts if needed to explain the architecture for future reference.

# Test Strategy:
Load a map view covering an area with known terrain data. Verify that colored terrain appears on the map corresponding to elevation. Pan and zoom to ensure new tiles are loaded and rendered correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Terrain Tile Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Dart component to manage terrain tiles and coordinate with MapLibre camera
### Details:
Develop a Dart component that monitors the visible map bounds and camera position from the MapLibre GL map. Implement logic to determine which terrain tiles need to be loaded based on the current view. Create a mechanism to request, load, and manage LERC terrain data for these tiles. Implement a queue system to prioritize loading tiles in the current viewport. Handle zoom level changes and calculate appropriate tile resolution. Document the tile management system architecture.

## 2. Implement Cross-Platform Communication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the channel for communicating between Dart and native platforms
### Details:
Design and implement a MethodChannel-based communication system between the Dart side and native platforms (Android/iOS). Define the message structure for sending decoded elevation data, tile coordinates, and rendering parameters to the native side. Implement serialization/deserialization of the terrain data for efficient transfer across the platform boundary. Create methods to send terrain updates when new tiles are loaded or parameters change. Implement handlers on both the Dart and native sides. Document the communication protocol.

## 3. Implement Android Terrain Rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement Android-side rendering of terrain data in the MapLibre GL view
### Details:
On the Android platform, implement native code to receive the decoded terrain data from the Dart side. Research how to hook into the MapLibre GL native rendering pipeline on Android, possibly using custom layers or overlays. Implement OpenGL/Vulkan rendering logic to display the terrain data visually on top of or integrated with the map. Create shaders for basic elevation-based coloring. Handle synchronization between the map view and terrain overlay. Ensure proper memory management for terrain data. Document the Android rendering implementation.

## 4. Implement iOS Terrain Rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement iOS-side rendering of terrain data in the MapLibre GL view
### Details:
On the iOS platform, implement native code to receive the decoded terrain data from the Dart side. Research how to hook into the MapLibre GL native rendering pipeline on iOS, possibly using custom layers or overlays. Implement Metal or OpenGL rendering logic to display the terrain data visually on top of or integrated with the map. Create shaders for basic elevation-based coloring. Handle synchronization between the map view and terrain overlay. Ensure proper memory management for terrain data. Document the iOS rendering implementation.
