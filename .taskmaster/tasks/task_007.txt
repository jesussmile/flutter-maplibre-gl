# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Terrain UI Controls
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop user interface controls within the MapLibre GL example page for adjusting terrain visualization parameters and switching modes.
# Details:
Refer to the following documentation for guidance: `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/basic_terrain_display_ui_controls.md` and `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/enhanced_visualization_ui_controls.md`. Note that the documentation was written for flutter_map and will need adaptation for MapLibre GL. Work exclusively within the `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/maplibre_gl_example` directory. Add Flutter UI widgets (e.g., `Slider` for reference altitude, `DropdownButton` or `Radio` buttons for visualization modes, `Switch` for toggling visibility) to the `terrain_page.dart`. Connect these UI controls to the terrain layer/rendering logic (e.g., via `Provider`, `Bloc`, or `ChangeNotifier`) to dynamically update visualization parameters. Ensure UI updates trigger map redraws where necessary. Document the UI design decisions, state management approach, and how the controls interact with the rendering pipeline. Include screenshots of the UI, explanations of each control's purpose, and any usability considerations that influenced the design. Document any performance optimizations implemented to ensure smooth UI interaction while rendering terrain.

# Test Strategy:
Interact with each UI control on the page. Verify that changing sliders, toggles, or dropdowns correctly updates the terrain visualization on the map in real-time. Ensure toggling visibility hides/shows the terrain layer.
