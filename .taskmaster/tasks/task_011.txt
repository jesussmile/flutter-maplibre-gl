# Task ID: 11
# Title: Cross-Platform Testing and Finalization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the LERC terrain visualization on different devices and platforms (Android, iOS) and finalize performance optimizations and documentation for the MapLibre GL example.
# Details:
Refer to the following documentation for guidance: `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/platform_specific_implementation.md` and `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation/performance_optimization_techniques.md`. Note that the documentation was written for flutter_map and will need adaptation for MapLibre GL. Work exclusively within the `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/maplibre_gl_example` directory for all testing and finalization. Test all implemented features (visualization modes, UI controls, caching, hillshading, altitude readout) on a range of target devices, including mid-range devices as specified in success metrics. Identify and fix performance bottlenecks using profiling tools. Ensure memory usage is within acceptable limits. Create comprehensive documentation covering setup, usage, and implementation details of the LERC terrain example. Compile all task-specific documentation into a unified reference document for future developers working with this code. Create a detailed troubleshooting guide addressing common issues that may be encountered. Document platform-specific differences and considerations. Include references to the original documentation in `/Users/pannam/Desktop/flutter-maplibre-gl/documentation` for additional details. Create a final report summarizing what worked well, what was challenging, and recommendations for future improvements.

# Test Strategy:
Execute test plans on multiple Android and iOS devices. Verify functionality, performance, and stability across platforms. Review and complete project documentation.
